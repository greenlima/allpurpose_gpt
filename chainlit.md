# allpurpose_gpt 🤖

Say Hi! 👋 to a new GPT-like assistant built with [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit)!!!

Tapping into Openai's GPT, 🤖 has conversational memory which allows you to have long conversations on any particular topic.

You can create the type of assistant that suits you best on start by prompting your reply to 🤖's first question:

I use 🤖 regularly for my daily 💻 work. I am sure he will be useful to you too 😊.
