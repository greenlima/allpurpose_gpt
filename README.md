Say Hi! ğŸ‘‹ to a new GPT-like assistant built with [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit).

Tapping into [Openai's GPT](https://openai.com/), ğŸ¤– has conversational memory which allows you to have long conversations on any particular topic.

You can create the type of assistant that suits you best on start by prompting your reply to ğŸ¤–'s first question:

</p>

I use ğŸ¤– regularly for my daily ğŸ’» work. I am sure ğŸ¤– will be useful to you too ğŸ˜Š.

## How to

I have not deployed the app yet, but you can run it locally with your own openai api key.

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a .env file in root with your OPENAI_API_KEY = "xxx"
3. Install the package. In terminal, type: make install_package
4. Run it! In terminal, type: make run_gpt
